Simply Love (StepMania 5)
======================

This is a modified version of Dan Guzek's Simply Love port for SM5. View the original project here: https://github.com/dguzek/Simply-Love-SM5

This version is tested up to StepMania 5.0.9 but may work with later versions. Dan's latest version has graphical options for both arrows and hearts among lots of other cool things.

Changes to this theme are primarily cosmetic.
